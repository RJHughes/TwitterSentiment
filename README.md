# Twitter Sentiment analysis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/RJHughes/TwitterSentiment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/RJHughes/TwitterSentiment)

To run the app, you'll need to have flask available in your environment. 

I'd suggest making a new virtualenv and running 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you then navigate to the TwitterSentiment folder you need to set the FLASK_APP environemtn variable. Run the below command
`export FLASK_APP=app/application.py`

You can then run

`flask run`

To run the site locally on localhost:5000

Other dependencies for the data analysis can be installed from the requirements.txt file
